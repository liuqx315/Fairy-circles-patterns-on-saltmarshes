# Fairy-circles-patterns-on-saltmarshes
This code for "L.-X. Zhao, K. Zhang, K. Siteur, X.-Z. Li, Q.-X. Liu, J. van de Koppel, Fairy circles reveal
the resilience of self-organized salt marshes". Sci. Adv. 7, eabe1100 (2021). doi: 10.1126/sciadv.abe1100. 

* The codes were implemented on anaconda platform with pyopencl package and Jupyter.
* Typical Fairy-circle patterns generated from proposal models I and model II, as well as output from classical Turing mechanism. 
* R codes generate the figures in the main text deposited at open-access Figshare.
* Simulation program of theoretical models.
